# Movies Data Base PCA Analysis
This project involves the collection and analysis of data on movies and TV series, including personal scores, expert reviews, and additional characteristics of each title. The goal is to predict the critic score using regression models and classify the genres of the titles.

## Project Features

* Ratings from at least 150 movies and TV series.
*Incorporate individual ratings, expert scores from platforms like Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, and Metacritic, enhancing the dataset's richness.
* The dataset includes essential information such as title names, individual and expert ratings, release year, genre, language, duration, budget, box office earnings, and the number of seasons for series.
* Employ methods to clean, standardize, and unify the dataset, ensuring accurate and reliable data for analysis.
* Utilize descriptive statistics and visualizations (e.g., histograms, correlations) to explore data trends and insights.
* Build and evaluate simple and multiple linear regression models to predict critic scores based on various predictors, determining which factors most influence ratings.
* Assess model effectiveness using metrics like RÂ², AIC, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
* Collect and analyze a separate set of new movies or series, applying the developed models to predict scores and evaluate the accuracy of those predictions.
* Use Jupyter notebooks for an organized, step-by-step workflow, allowing for easy understanding and interaction with the data and analysis process.
